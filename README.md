The main script is called demo.m, which is a MTALAB code that provides data descriptions and analyses demos.

MATLAB code is provided in ***functions***.

Each folder below corresponds to one of the main sections in the manuscript, containing relevant source data and computed metrics:

### MapGradient

   Map the functional connectivity gradients for the human subcortex.

### fMRI-tractoraphy

   Model the functional connectivity gradients using fMRI-tractography.

### GeoNull

   Model selection. Compare gradient magnitude with null data.

### Group-Parcellation

   ***3T:*** Four scales of hierarchical parcellation for the human subcortex delineated using 3T resting-state fMRI data. The atlas is in MNI standard space with a spatial resolution of 2mm isotropic. Label of each region in a given atlas is provided in a text file. 

   ***7T:*** Four scales of hierarchical parcellation for the human subcortex delineated using 7T resting-state fMRI data. The atlas is in MNI standard space with a spatial resolution of 1.6mm isotropic.

### Homogeneity

   Estimate the functional homogeneity of delineated atlas.

### Individual-Parcellation

   Train a support-vector machine (SVM) classifier and apply the classifier to generate personalized parcellation.
   
### Behavior

   Decompose high dimensional behavioral data into 5 dimensions using independent component analysis (ICA).
