Model selection: Use a geometry-preserving null model to test the null hypothesis that gradient each magnitude peak is not significantly larger in magnitude than what could be expected due to chance and/or the effects of geometry. A regional boundary is delineated at the location of gradient magnitude peaks for which the null hypothesis can be rejected. Spatial variation is represented as a continuum when the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
